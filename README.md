![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-26 at 13 01 22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e16e97ab-c08b-4e30-a692-6344831f1a62)

AFI (Active Fan Interaction) is a web-based Fan Engagement Platform designed for sports fans, with a first implementation focused on Golden State Warriors supporters.

The platform transforms passive sports consumption into an interactive, community-driven digital experience that operates 365 days a year — both during the main season and off-season.

---

## 🎯 Project Context

Sports organizations face a critical and growing challenge: keeping fans engaged beyond live matches.

- During off-season, digital activity and community interaction drop significantly.
- Even in active season, most fans consume content passively (just watching scores or streams).
- There is limited real-time interaction between fans and few data-driven engagement mechanics.

AFI addresses this by providing a real-time web platform that offers **constant, interactive and community-centric experiences** all year long.
