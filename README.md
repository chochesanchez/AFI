AFI (Active Fan Interaction) is a web-based Fan Engagement Platform designed specifically for Golden State Warriors fans.

The platform transforms passive sports consumption into an interactive, community-driven digital experience that operates 365 days a year — both during the NBA season and off-season.

## 🎯 Project Context

Sports organizations face a critical challenge:

- Engagement drops drastically during off-season.
- Even during live matches, most fans consume content passively.
- There is limited real-time interaction between fans.
- Data-driven engagement opportunities are underutilized.

AFI addresses these challenges by providing:

- Real-time interactive experiences.
- Gamification systems.
- Weekly AI-powered challenges.
- Emotional community-driven features.
- Long-term loyalty mechanics.
